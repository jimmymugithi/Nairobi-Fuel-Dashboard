# ⛽ PetroTrack - Nairobi Fuel Station Dashboard

## 📝 Description

**PetroTrack** is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users in Nairobi, Kenya to view and compare fuel stations by price, brand, location, fuel types, and available services. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and uses a mock REST API provided by `json-server`.

Users can:
- See a list of fuel stations in Nairobi.
- Search stations by name or location.
- Select stations by fuel brand (e.g., Shell, Total, Rubis).
- Toggle between light and dark themes for better user experience.
